  ###i assumed that abhimanyu can't recharge his powers in the middle of a battle
    a = no. of enemies abhimanyu can skip
    b = no. of abhimanyu can recharge his power
    p = power of abhimanyu
    here 'powers' are the enemy powers (i.e. k1,k2,...,k11)
    since k3 and k7 will attack back after regenerating half of their powers in the next circle(i.e. k4 and k8)
    the enemy powers will be k1,k2,k3,(k4+k3/2),k5,k6,k7,(k8+k7/2),k9,k10,k11.
    if abimanyus max power < any of remaining enemies power then he can't cross the circle(He fails)
    abhimanyu will skip 'a' enemies with highest power
    battling in each circle will result in loss of the same power from abhimanyu as the enemy
    abhimanyu can recharge his power 'b' times
